                <h2>Sustainability and Renewable Energy Sources</h2>
                <p>Due to Kazakhstan’s remote position from all big sources of water and proximity to water-conflicting states like Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, our country is highly vulnerable to climate change consequences. This is why <strong>sustainability</strong> is my biggest professional interest at the moment.</p>
                <p>My primary goal is to work closely with oil & gas companies in the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) sphere to promote renewable energy sources (RES) implementation. I recently completed a policy memo addressed to Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Energy, focusing on the challenges and opportunities of integrating RES into the country's energy sector. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b1fQlUiuX2aVpzus0-fitkUR43NTot42RP-NPqyuHIc/edit">Download the memo here</a>.</p>

                <h2>Asian Development Bank Internship</h2>
                <p>In April, I completed an internship at the Asian Development Bank, where I contributed to a project on decarbonizing the heating sector in Kazakhstan. This experience was incredibly valuable for my personal and professional growth. I gained hands-on experience in working with major stakeholders to create actionable solutions for reducing carbon emissions in critical sectors of the economy.</p>

                <h2>Research in Renewable Energy Solutions</h2>
                <p>As part of my academic journey, I have been actively engaged in research on renewable energy technologies. In collaboration with industry experts and researchers, we have explored various solutions, including solar, wind, and biomass energy. Our focus has been on identifying the barriers to RES implementation in Kazakhstan and proposing feasible solutions.</p>
                <p>In the context of the Kazakhstani energy landscape, I believe the key challenges are regulatory obstacles, lack of infrastructure, and financial constraints. My research has aimed at addressing these challenges by working on policy frameworks that encourage investments in sustainable energy solutions. Additionally, I have published several articles on <strong>decarbonization strategies</strong> for the heating and power sectors.</p>

        <h2>Current Situation in Kazakhstan</h2>
        <p>Kazakhstan is at a critical juncture where the energy sector must adapt to global trends in decarbonization. While the country is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, there is growing recognition of the need to diversify energy sources by integrating renewables. Through my work, I hope to contribute to this transition, ensuring that Kazakhstan adopts a more sustainable energy model.</p>
