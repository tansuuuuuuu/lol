                <h2>My Love for Music</h2>
                <p>Besides my professional interests, I also have multiple hobbies that are of huge interest to me, the biggest one being music. All of my family members play some kind of instruments: my dad plays guitar and bass, my mom and sister play piano. Being surrounded my music ever since my childhood I have decided to pick up playing on <strong>guitar, drums and bass.</strong></p>

                <h2>My Band Experience</h2>
                <p>After mastering these instruments, I decided to form a <strong> band with my friends </strong> during my university years. Playing music with friends is an experience I highly recommendâ€”there's nothing quite like it! We even got the opportunity to perform at Astana Ball, a major charity event at our university, which was an unforgettable experience.</p>

        <h2>Why Music is Important</h2>
        <p>Music plays an important role in my life. It allows me to express myself creatively and connect with others on a deeper level. Music can bring people together, and being in a community where everyone shares a passion for music keeps the love for it alive. Everyone should try to explore music in some way, whether by learning an instrument, singing, or simply enjoying a live performance.</p>
